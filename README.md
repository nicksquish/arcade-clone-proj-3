# Classic Arcade Game Clone
# or, Nick's Project Three Submission

This is a clone of the classic arcade game, Frogger! It is a hot, humid, summer day. Avoid the dastardly bugs to make your way to the cool, refreshing waters at the top of the screen.

#How to access game

Using your command line (or Git Bash), clone the files from github:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nicksquish/arcade-clone-proj-3
```
Once the files are downloaded, launch index.html into your browser of choice and begin playing!

# How to play

Use your keyboards arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) to navigate your way past the enemy bugs to the water at the top of the screen. Colliding with an enemy will reset your character to the starting point, so take it slow and avoid those bugs!

# Dependencies

This project was built using starter code and images provided by the fine folks at Udacity.
